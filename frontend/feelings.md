# What makes me sad about stack
1. no typescript support for @carbon/react
2. when do you want to customize/style a component, you need to lurk in source code a lot
3. working with @carbon/react is very unproductive
4. it's unable to know, what styles do you need to import with particular components

# What makes me happy about stack
1. a nice storybook with examples and documentation
